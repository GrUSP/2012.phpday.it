<p>We are happy to introduce you Lorna Jane, an experienced PHP consultant, developer,  trainer and leading the <a href="https://joind.in" target="_blank">joind.in</a> open source project.</p>
<p>She will give a session at phpDay called “<a href="https://2012.phpday.it/talk/best-practice-in-api-design/">Best Practice In API Design</a>” Fri 18th May at 11 am on track 2.</p>
<p>Here’s her interview:</p>
<p><em><strong> Things that you consider before choosing a framework for a project?</strong></em><br />
Whether I&#8217;ve used it before, how good their documentation is, how good<br />
their community is, and whether anyone would recommend this tool to<br />
me.  Bonus points if I know the main developer(s) and am confident I<br />
can get help if I need it!</p>
<p><em><strong>What should I learn next?</strong></em><br />
Ask yourself this question after a conference; we come together and<br />
get exposed to so many new ideas.  Pick the one that you&#8217;re still<br />
thinking about two days later, not the one that you &#8220;ought&#8221; to be<br />
doing next.  Our passion is what makes us who we are &#8211; so follow<br />
yours.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your thoughts about functional programming?</strong></em><br />
Love it and will still write code this way if I&#8217;m doing something that<br />
does have a beginning, a middle, and an end!</p>
<p><em><strong>Who&#8217;s your programming hero?</strong></em><br />
How could I choose just one??  The people I look up to the most are<br />
the people who have taken the time to look down to me, and help me<br />
take one more step towards where I am today and where I will be in the<br />
future.  Not just those that have interacted with me directly, but<br />
also people whose blogs I&#8217;ve read, whose books I have, and whose talks<br />
I&#8217;ve seen.</p>
<p><em><strong>What features would you like to see in the next PHP version?</strong></em><br />
I&#8217;m pretty happy with PHP right now, but I&#8217;m excited about the<br />
improvements on pecl_http and the suggestion that it might be in core<br />
one day.</p>
<p><em><strong>What&#8217;s the average beer per hour factor during conferences and a normal hangout?</strong></em><br />
I&#8217;m pretty consistent about my beer intake, regardless of what kind of<br />
event I&#8217;m at.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about php 5.4 traits?</strong><br />
I think they&#8217;re a great feature but lots of the explanations of traits<br />
that I&#8217;ve seen make them seem complicated.  I&#8217;m sure as more people<br />
start to use them, we&#8217;ll understand them better as a whole community.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you like and what not about php?</strong></em><br />
I love how anyone can get started, but some days I hate that anyone<br />
can get started!</p>
<p><strong><em>Which opensource projects are you following the most?</em></strong><br />
Actually I&#8217;m leading one,<a title="Joind.in" href="https://joind.in" target="_blank"> joind.in</a>!  I have been watching the Symfony<br />
2 and ZF2 framework projects too, and I love the new PHPDocumentor2<br />
project.</p>
<p><em><strong>Did your love for programming cause you some troubles with your partner?</strong></em><br />
Actually my husband Kevin introduced me to programming and taught me a<br />
lot, you can meet him at phpDay :)</p>
<p><em><strong>Suggest a book to read.</strong></em><br />
I&#8217;m totally biased of course but you could always read my new book<br />
&#8220;PHP Master&#8221;, co-authored with Davey Shafik and Matt Turland.</p>
