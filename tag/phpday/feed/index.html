				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the ninth &#8216;social&#8217; interview in a series with the phpDay 2012 speakers:<br />
it’s ‘social’ because the questions have been submitted and voted online on Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="https://2012.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/giorgio-sironi.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-272" title="Giorgio Sironi" src="https://2012.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/giorgio-sironi.jpg" alt="Giorgio Sironi" width="97" height="97" /></a> We are happy to introduce you<a title="stefano mainardi bio" href="https://2012.phpday.it/speakers/stefano-mainardi/"> </a><a href="https://2012.phpday.it/speakers/giorgio-sironi/">Giorgio Sironi</a>, a freelance PHP developer and PHPUnit_Selenium mantainer.</p>
<p>He will give a session at phpDay called &#8220;<a href="https://2012.phpday.it/talk/what-they-didnt-tell-you-about-object-oriented-programming-in-php/">What they didn&#8217;t tell you about object programming in PHP</a>&#8221;  Friday 18th May at 11:00 am on track 1.</p>
<p>The Interview:</p>
<p><em><strong>Things that you consider before choosing a framework for a project?</strong></em><br />
Community, documentation, training of my colleagues, and whether I should not use a framework for this project.</p>
<p><em><strong>What should I learn next?</strong></em><br />
Some economics and theory of constraints.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your thoughts about functional programmin</strong></em>g?<br />
Keep an eye on it &#8211; functional languages like Erlang do not only &#8220;solve&#8221; the problem of concurrency but also that of distribution.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sheldon or Leonard?</strong></em><br />
I think that the characters have undergone a progressive Flanderization towards the absurd, due to many filler episodes and an emphasis on product placement instead of geek culture and plot (Sheldon-style response).</p>
<p><em><strong>Who&#8217;s your programming hero?</strong></em><br />
The one that doesn&#8217;t work overtime. Or Alan Kay.</p>
<p><em><strong>What features would you like to see in the next PHP version?</strong></em><br />
Scala case classes, native PSR-0 autoloading and scalar type hints.</p>
<p><em><strong>Who killed JFK?</strong></em><br />
I feel there is already too much an American domination in our culture to allocate time to this question.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about php 5.4 traits?</strong></em><br />
Like inheritance, sometimes useful and easily abused.</p>
<p><em><strong>Duran Duran or Spandau Ballet?</strong></em><br />
I was born in &#8217;88. Who are these people? :)</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you like and what not about php?</strong></em><br />
I like the ease of deployment, hosting support and dynamic typing. I do not like the kitchen-sink let&#8217;s-add-goto and makeCoffee() development model and the focus on procedural programming of the native extensions.</p>
<p><em><strong>Which opensource projects are you following the most?</strong></em><br />
PHPUnit and related projects due to my focus on testing as executable specification.</p>
<p><em><strong>Did your love for programming cause you some troubles with your partner?</strong></em><br />
It did, but I think I have a balance now.</p>
<p><em><strong>Suggest a book to read.</strong></em><br />
Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand.</p>
<p>You can find Giorgio on twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/giorgiosironi">@giorgiosironi</a>) or on his <a href="https://www.giorgiosironi.com/">blog</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the eighth &#8216;social&#8217; interview in a series with the phpDay 2012 speakers:<br />
it’s ‘social’ because the questions have been submitted and voted online on Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="https://2012.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/stefano-mainardi.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-291" title="Stefano Mainardi" src="https://2012.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/stefano-mainardi.jpg" alt="" width="77" height="77" /></a> We are happy to introduce you<a title="stefano mainardi bio" href="https://2012.phpday.it/speakers/stefano-mainardi/"> Stefano Mainardi</a>, a senior PHP developer and <a href="https://www.twinbit.it/">Twinbit</a> project manager and <a href="https://ildn.net/">ILDN &#8211; Italian Linux Distribution Network </a> - founder.</p>
<p>He will give a session at phpDay called &#8220;<a href="https://2012.phpday.it/talk/mobile-drupal/">Mobile Drupal</a>&#8220; Friday 18th May at 12:00 am on track 1.</p>
<p>The Interview:</p>
<p><em><strong>Things that you consider before choosing a framework for a project?</strong></em><br />
The first thing I check is if the name begins with &#8220;Dru&#8221; and ends with &#8220;Pal&#8221;. After this bad joke, the three things I consider essential for a good framework are: community, documentation and feedback from other developers.</p>
<p><em><strong>What should i learn next?</strong></em><br />
Have you heard of Symfony and Drupal 8? :-)<br />
From the human side, speaking in public is something that every good developer should be able to do, if you have ever done, perhaps it&#8217;s time to give it a try.<br />
Finally find more effective techniques for managing your time.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your thoughts about functional programming?</strong></em><br />
Before answering this question I should ask for a consultation at my law firm</p>
<p><em><strong>Sheldon or Leonard?</strong></em><br />
I’m not a big fan, or rather I never had the time to be. I saw a couple of episodes, but I would say that Sheldon is the perfect revenge of any nerds of this planet</p>
<p><em><strong>Who&#8217;s your programming hero?</strong></em><br />
Usually my brother. Ok, seriously, I have no heroes, in the strictest sense of the word. All people who contribute every day to create models of freedom for pure spirit of sharing are my undisputed hero.</p>
<p><em><strong>What features would you like to see in the next PHP version?</strong></em><br />
A native compiler like HipHop from Facebook</p>
<p><strong>Who killed JFK?</strong><br />
Leland Palmer</p>
<p><em><strong>What&#8217;s the average beer per hour factor during conferences and a normal hangout?</strong></em><br />
Whenever I have the perfect algorithm to share with the world, I drink more beer than ever that makes me forget everything.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about php 5.4 traits?</strong></em><br />
A great leap forward.</p>
<p><em><strong>Duran Duran or Spandau Ballet?</strong></em><br />
This is the perfect scenario of the failing question selection algorithm.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you like and what not about php?</strong></em><br />
I love the community, but do not like the lack of self criticism.</p>
<p><em><strong>Which opensource projects are you following the most?</strong></em><br />
Come on, should I really say that again? :P</p>
<p><em><strong>Did your love for programming cause you some troubles with your partner?</strong></em><br />
No, she always believed I was some kind of genius, and it&#8217;s nice to make her believe that. I am also leaving an aura of mystery into believing that I have superpowers that I never revealed</p>
<p><em><strong>Suggest a book to read.</strong></em><br />
I suggest you to contact Jacopo Romei (<a href="https://twitter.com/jacoporomei">@jacoporomei</a>) and ask him what&#8217;s the next book to read: he has a foolproof algorithm.</p>
<p>You can find Stefano on twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/stefanomainardi">@stefanomainardi</a>) and on his <a href="https://www.stefanomainardi.com/">blog</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the seventh &#8216;social&#8217; interview in a series with the phpDay 2012 speakers:<br />
it’s ‘social’ because the questions have been submitted and voted online on Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="https://2012.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/enrico_zimuel.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-261" title="Enrico Zimuel" src="https://2012.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/enrico_zimuel-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="90" height="90" /></a> We are happy to introduce you <a href="https://2012.phpday.it/speakers/enrico-zimuel/">Enrico Zimuel</a>, a senior PHP Engineer at Zend Technologies,  member of the Zend  Framework core team and founder of the<a href="https://torino.grusp.org/"> PHP user group Torino</a>.</p>
<p>He will give a session at phpDay called &#8220;<a title="A quick start on Zend Framework 2" href="https://2012.phpday.it/talk/a-quick-start-on-zend-framework-2/">A quick start on Zend Framework 2</a>&#8220; Saturday 19th May at 11:00 pm on track 1.</p>
<p>The Interview:</p>
<p><em><strong>Things that you consider before choosing a framework for a project?</strong></em><br />
As you know I work in the Zend Framework core team, so my answer may be biased :)<br />
Anyway, I think the most important questions to ask around a framework are:<br />
- Are the features of the framework compliant to the requirements of the project?<br />
- The framework is supported by a community? How much is big that community?<br />
- The framework is well documented? Is easy to find information on the framework?<br />
- In case you have to develop a business project, there is a commerical support of the framework?</p>
<p><em><strong>What should i learn next?</strong></em><br />
I&#8217;m a software engineer since 1996 and one of the most important thing that I learned so far is that there every day there is always something new to learn. For PHP developers now I think is important know how to develop APIs and spend some time to learn how to use Javascript to interact with PHP.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your thoughts about functional programming?</strong></em><br />
I use the functional programming every day, mostly for scripting scope. Of course, if I have to develop a big project I prefer OOP. The architectural advantages of OOP are too big compared with functional programming.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sheldon or Leonard?</strong></em><br />
I have to say Sheldon but I feel more Leonard, to be honest.</p>
<p><em><strong>Who&#8217;s your programming hero?</strong></em><br />
My programming heroes are all the people that every day contribute to improve the open source softwares. This community is my programming hero.</p>
<p><em><strong>What features would you like to see in the next PHP version?</strong></em><br />
I would like to see less features and more consistency. I think this is a good time for the PHP project to consolidate the features released so far.</p>
<p><em><strong>What&#8217;s the average beer per hour factor during conferences and a normal hangout?</strong></em><br />
I like beer and I think conferences are a social happening to share a couple of beers.<br />
I said a couple of beers, not per hour :)</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about php 5.4 traits?</strong></em><br />
I think traits are very useful structures and we have some valid use cases in the Zend Framework project where to use it (but we cannot use it because the PHP 5.3 requirement). I&#8217;m sure we will see more and more examples on how to use it in the future, now they are mostly unexplored in the PHP community.</p>
<p><em><strong>Duran Duran or Spandau Ballet?</strong></em><br />
No comment.</p>
<p><strong><em>What do you like and what not about php?</em></strong><br />
I like the power of PHP and, at the same time,  I don&#8217;t like the power of PHP. If you know what you are doing the PHP is a very good tool for web developers. If you don&#8217;t know how PHP works you can do very big mistakes.</p>
<p><em><strong>Which opensource projects are you following the most?</strong></em><br />
Of course, I follow the Zend Framework project and sometimes I look to some other competitors :) I follow many others open source projects, mostly not PHP related like OpenSSL, GnuPG, Ubuntu, etc.</p>
<p><strong><em>Did your love for programming cause you some troubles with your partner?</em></strong><br />
No, but sometimes I was very close.</p>
<p><strong><em>Suggest a book to read.</em></strong><br />
I would like to suggest the book of Frederick P. Brooks &#8220;The Design of Design: Essays from a Computer Scientist&#8221; (Addison-Wesley Professional, 2010), it&#8217;s a really interesting reading about the process of design, from the prospective of a famous computer scientist.<br />
For the italian folks I strongly suggest a new book about PHP, &#8220;<a href="https://www.phpbestpractices.it/">PHP Best Practices</a>&#8221; published by FAG Edizioni. I&#8217;m one of the co-authors :)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the sixth &#8216;social&#8217; interview in a series with the phpDay 2012 speakers:<br />
it’s ‘social’ because the questions have been submitted and voted online on Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="https://2012.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/jordi-boggiano.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-275" title="Jordi Boggiano" src="https://2012.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/jordi-boggiano-150x150.jpg" alt="Jordi Boggiano" width="90" height="90" /></a> We are happy to introduce you <a href="https://2012.phpday.it/speakers/jordi-boggiano/">Jordi Boggiano</a>,  the author of a few open source apps/libs (Composer, Monolog, php-console etc.), and frequent contributor to other OSS projects (Symfony2, Twig and others).</p>
<p>He will give a session at phpDay called &#8220;<a title="Dependency Management with Composer" href="https://2012.phpday.it/talk/dependency-management-with-composer/">Dependency Management with Composer</a>&#8221;  Saturday 19th May at 15:30 pm on track 1.</p>
<p>The Interview:</p>
<p><strong>Things that you consider before choosing a framework for a project?</strong><em><br />
</em> Usually the expected project duration is the main factor. If it&#8217;s going to have to be maintained for the next 5 years, unless it&#8217;s really really simple, I generally start with Symfony. Otherwise Silex for simple/short-term projects. Obviously that&#8217;s based on my personal knowledge, and it does not apply to everyone.</p>
<p><strong>What are your thoughts about functional programming?</strong><br />
Answering this question would not be without side effects.</p>
<p><strong>What features would you like to see in the next PHP version?</strong><br />
Native Unicode support.</p>
<p><strong>Who killed JFK?</strong><br />
Who voted for questions like this? In both cases, I guess sometimes it&#8217;s best if we don&#8217;t know the answer :)</p>
<p><em><strong>What&#8217;s the average beer per hour factor during conferences and a normal hangout?</strong></em><br />
Given $now and $start being unix timestamp, this should draw an accurate function of beer bottles per hour:</p>
<p>$attendees * 9 / M_PI * 2000 * (1.5 / min(3600*3, $now &#8211; $start))</p>
<p>You can try to make a chart out of it as an exercise ;)</p>
<p><strong>Which opensource projects are you following the most?</strong><br />
Composer because I spend most of my free time working on it lately. The<br />
rest is mostly piling up unread notifications on github.</p>
<p><strong>Suggest a book to read.</strong><br />
If you like spaceships and sci-fi, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_Cantos">the Hyperion Cantos</a> is great.</p>
<p>You can find Jordi on twitter (<a title="seldaek twitter" href="https://twitter.com/seldaek">@seldaek</a>) or on<a title="nelm.io jordi" href="https://nelm.io/jordi"> nelm.io page</a>.</p>

The learning curve is important, but also if you&#8217;re looking for components or a more full-stack implementation.</p>
<p><em><strong>What should i learn next?</strong></em><br />
Learn C and contribute to PHP. I should start doing that myself, but haven&#8217;t yet. Try to learn about Devops, it&#8217;s interesting material.</p>

The possibility to pre-compile PHP apps/files either in a compiled phar format or just as compiled php files. </p>
<p><em><strong>Who killed JFK?</strong></em><br />
Your mom (sorry for that). Euhhmmm &#8230; the US government &#8230; I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><em><strong>What&#8217;s the average beer per hour factor during conferences and a normal hangout?</strong></em><br />
I don&#8217;t even drink alcohol.</p>

I kinda like it.</p>
<p><em><strong>Duran Duran or Spandau Ballet?</strong></em><br />
Slayer!!!</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you like and what not about php?</strong></em><br />
I love the PHP community, but PHP as a language could be more ambitious.</p>
<p><em><strong>Which opensource projects are you following the most?</strong></em><br />
Varnish, Nginx, Zend Framework, PHP itself.</p>
<p><em><strong>Did your love for programming cause you some troubles with your partner?</strong></em><br />
No but the fact that I go to conferences all the time did.</p>
<p><em><strong>Suggest a book to read.</strong></em><br />
Evolution of a cro-magnon by John Joseph.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the fourth ‘social’ interview in a series with the phpDay 2012 speakers: it’s ‘social’ because the questions have been submitted and voted online on Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="https://2012.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Lukas-Kahwe-Smith.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-281" title="Lukas Kahwe Smith" src="https://2012.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Lukas-Kahwe-Smith-150x150.jpg" alt="Lukas Kahwe Smith" width="90" height="90" /></a> We are happy to introduce you <a title="Lukas smith bio" href="https://2012.phpday.it/speakers/lukas-kahwe-smith/" target="_blank">Lukas Smith</a>, an experienced PHP developer, he spends most of his time playing with Symfony2 as well as pushing the PHPCR ecosystem.</p>
<p>He will give a session at phpDay called &#8220;<a title="phpcr lukas talk" href="https://2012.phpday.it/talk/phpcr-php-content-repository-specification/" target="_blank">PHPCR – PHP Content Repository Specification</a>&#8221; Friday 18th May at 5:30 pm on track 2.</p>
<p>The Interview:</p>
<p><strong>Things that you consider before choosing a framework for a project?</strong><br />
As I work in a web agency, the main criteria is does it cover the common use cases. Does it do this in a way that facilitates code reuse and testing?<br />
Furthermore how strong is the community in producing quality extensions and supporting each other?</p>
<p><em><strong>What should i learn next?</strong></em><br />
PHPCR :)</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your throughts about functional programming?</strong></em><br />
Its been a while since I have taken a serious look at functional programming. Back in University we learned Opal. I loved the beauty of the final solutions, but dreaded refactoring.</p>
<p><em><strong>Who&#8217;s your programming hero?</strong></em><br />
My father. I still remember when we got this weird Apricot computer and he wrote an english word trainer in Basic. I &#8220;played&#8221; with it all day :)</p>
<p><strong><em>What features would you like to see in the next PHP version?</em></strong><br />
Getting interfaces for common stuff like caching, logging, http request/response etc.</p>
<p><strong><em>What&#8217;s the average beer per hour factor during conferences and a normal hangout?</em></strong><br />
0.0</p>
<p><strong><em>What do you think about php 5.4 traits?</em></strong><br />
I would have preferred Grafts (<a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/horizontalreuse#grafts_-_class_composition_not_implemented">https://wiki.php.net/rfc/horizontalreuse#grafts_-_class_composition_not_implemented</a>)<br />
We still have a lot of learning to do, but it has the potential of becoming a very significant tool for PHP developers.</p>
<p><strong><em>What do you like and what not about php?</em></strong><br />
I like that so far I never felt that a problem I needed to solve required me to program in another language.</p>
<p><em><strong>Which opensource projects are you following the most?</strong></em><br />
Symfony2 and PHPCR .. though I guess these days also Drupal, despite having never used it, let alone installed it :)</p>
<p><em><strong>Suggest a book to read.</strong></em><br />
I know SQL is not hip these days, but &#8220;SQL Performance Tuning&#8221; by Peter Gulutzan and Trudy Pelzer was probably the most important book for my career. I learned so much, which gave me the confidence to really step up and from there I was able to grow my knowledge in every direction I needed to go.</p>

<p>We are happy to introduce you <a title="jacopo romei bio" href="https://2012.phpday.it/speakers/jacopo-romei/" target="_blank">Jacopo Romei</a>, an experienced PHP developer and agile coach.</p>
<p>He will give a session at phpDay called “<a href="https://2012.phpday.it/talk/symfony-cmf/">Symfony CMF</a>” Fri 18th May at 5 pm on track 2 and the workshop &#8220;<a title="test driven development with symfony2" href="https://2012.phpday.it/talk/test-driven-development-with-symfony-2/" target="_blank">Test Driven Development with Symfony2</a>&#8221; Fri 18th May at 11 am on track 3.</p>
<p>Here’s her interview:</p>
<p><em><strong>Things that you consider before choosing a framework for a project?</strong></em><br />
Is it mainstream? Is it supported by a *huge* community? If it&#8217;s<br />
exotic, does it feature something worth its exoticness? Is it *truly*<br />
decoupled and not just packed down in procedures?<br />
The hardest one: do I really need a framework? Often the answer is<br />
&#8220;yes&#8221;, but &#8220;often&#8221; is never &#8220;always&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong><em>What should i learn next?</em></strong><br />
To communicate. Never seen a project fail for a strictly technical<br />
reason. Effective communication is a keypoint. Even good code is a way<br />
to communicate and &#8211; you know? &#8211; it&#8217;s a way to communicate on the<br />
human side of the project. PC would love assembly, so let&#8217;s remind we<br />
write code for humans. :-)</p>
<p><strong><em>What are your thoughts about functional programming?</em></strong><br />
I love it. &#8220;Maybe I&#8217;m amazed&#8221; of the way we keep teaching procedural<br />
style first, then OOP and maybe, at last, functional paradigm. I was<br />
lucky enough to be taught functional programming very early, among<br />
fellow students complaining for those lectures. My default choice for<br />
everyday development is OOP by the way.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sheldon or Leonard?</strong></em><br />
Leonard. Sheldon is funny, but I&#8217;d kill him if it was true and closer<br />
than 50m from me. :-)</p>
<p><em><strong>Who&#8217;s your programming hero?</strong></em><br />
The open source community. If all the efforts and money now put<br />
somewhere else in IT were put in the open source community, we would<br />
live in a way better world. People cares too much about performance or<br />
about design while if only we understood IT is the core of our next<br />
future life, we wouldn&#8217;t give up the open source development model.<br />
All in all Firefox made us free of Internet Explorer, not Chrome. ;-)<br />
Who made the biggest step for a better life?</p>
<p><em><strong>What features would you like to see in the next PHP version?</strong></em><br />
Pure dreamland OK? I&#8217;d love some easy way to compile my PHP libraries<br />
into a PHP extension. I know something similar exists, but here I mean<br />
*easy* as in &#8220;beer&#8221; ;-)</p>
<p><em><strong>Who killed JFK?</strong></em><br />
Gabriella Golia.</p>
<p><em><strong>What&#8217;s the average beer per hour factor during conferences and a normal hangout?</strong></em><br />
4 vs. 1.5.<br />
Though phpDay could feature a lower rate because of Spritz.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about php 5.4 traits?</strong></em><br />
Sharing behaviors horizontally among classes is something I love and<br />
always strive for. I love traits concept and I&#8217;ve been waiting for<br />
them so long. Now it&#8217;s time to get the fun out of them.</p>
<p><em><strong>Duran Duran or Spandau Ballet?</strong></em><br />
This is the hardest one to answer. Duran Duran&#8230;</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you like and what not about php?</strong></em><br />
I *hate* its syntax and all the boilerplate. E.g. I love python&#8217;s<br />
enforced indentation.<br />
I like PHP community and its broad mixed paradigm, going from lambda<br />
functions to *mature* OOP.</p>
<p><em><strong>Which opensource projects are you following the most?</strong></em><br />
Symfony CMF, definitely.<br />
Arduino is also taking some mind-share of mine.</p>
<p><em><strong>Did your love for programming cause you some troubles with your partner?</strong></em><br />
Never. I don&#8217;t overprogram, I hate overtime. I want my life to be<br />
healthy and doing too much of one thing is unhealthy.<br />
Conferences on the other hand are a nice excuse to share some time<br />
travelling together.</p>
<p><em><strong>Suggest a book to read.</strong></em><br />
&#8220;The Black Swan&#8221; by Nassim Taleb.<br />
&#8220;Pro PHP Refactoring&#8221; by Francesco Trucchia and<br />
