				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the tenth &#8216;social&#8217; interview in a series with the phpDay 2012 speakers:<br />
it’s ‘social’ because the questions have been submitted and voted online on Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="https://2012.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dbu.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-267" style="float: left; padding: 0 10px 10px 0;" title="David Buchmann" src="https://2012.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dbu.jpg" alt="David Buchmann" width="108" height="101" /></a> We are happy to introduce you<a title="David Buchman bio" href="https://2012.phpday.it/speakers/david-buchman/"> </a><a href="https://2012.phpday.it/speakers/david-buchmann/">David Buchmann</a>. He is one of the core developers of the Jackalope implementation of <a href="https://phpcr.github.com/">PHPCR</a> and he works hard to make <a href="https://cmf.symfony.com/">the Symfony Content   Management Framework</a> happen.</p>
<p>He will give a session at phpDay called &#8220;<a href="https://2012.phpday.it/talk/step-by-step-making-a-website-fly-with-assetic-varnish-and-esi/">Step By Step: Making a website fly with Assetic, Varnish and ESI</a>&#8221;  Friday 18th May at 2:30 pm on track 3.</p>
<p>The Interview:</p>
<p><em><strong>Things that you consider before choosing a framework for a project?</strong></em><br />
* how long is the project supposed to stay on line?<br />
* which tools does my team already know?<br />
* is this more a project with standard cases and some customization (we want a feature-rich framework and customize it) or is it highly custom (we take a lower level framework and build custom things on top of it)</p>
<p><em><strong>What should I learn next?</strong></em><br />
The Symfony2 SonataAdminBundle</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your thoughts about functional programming?</strong></em><br />
I had courses on scheme at university, but its darn hard to really think functional. just passing around callbacks and having closures is not functional programming.</p>
<p><em><strong>Who&#8217;s your programming hero?</strong></em><br />
Fabien Potentier</p>
<p><em><strong>What features would you like to see in the next PHP version?</strong></em><br />
More documentation for the chapters that lack documentation.</p>
<p><em><strong>Who killed JFK?</strong></em><br />
Not me :-&gt;</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about php 5.4 traits?</strong></em><br />
Interesting idea but I have yet to try them out.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you like and what not about php?</strong></em><br />
The weak typing and no compilers make it so fast do develop. it is made for the web. the language is really maturing and getting rid (or at least deprecating) stupid things.<br />
There are great frameworks like Symfony2 evolving, without getting the bloatedness of the java world.<br />
What I like less is the inconsistency in basic methods names or parameter order.</p>
<p><em><strong>Which opensource projects are you following the most?</strong></em><br />
Symfony2, Jackalope.</p>
<p><em><strong>Did your love for programming cause you some troubles with your partner?</strong></em><br />
Nah, she is happy to have somebody who can not only fix her computer but also create her a homepage :-)</p>
<p><em><strong>Suggest a book to read.</strong></em><br />
<em><strong></strong></em>David Brin &#8211; Postman.<br />
Or did you mean a tech book? I have not red any printed tech book last year, it&#8217;s all in the internets :-)</p>
<p>You can find David on twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/dbu">@dbu</a>) .</p>
