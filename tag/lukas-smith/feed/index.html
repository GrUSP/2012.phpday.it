				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the fourth ‘social’ interview in a series with the phpDay 2012 speakers: it’s ‘social’ because the questions have been submitted and voted online on Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="https://2012.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Lukas-Kahwe-Smith.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-281" title="Lukas Kahwe Smith" src="https://2012.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Lukas-Kahwe-Smith-150x150.jpg" alt="Lukas Kahwe Smith" width="90" height="90" /></a> We are happy to introduce you <a title="Lukas smith bio" href="https://2012.phpday.it/speakers/lukas-kahwe-smith/" target="_blank">Lukas Smith</a>, an experienced PHP developer, he spends most of his time playing with Symfony2 as well as pushing the PHPCR ecosystem.</p>
<p>He will give a session at phpDay called &#8220;<a title="phpcr lukas talk" href="https://2012.phpday.it/talk/phpcr-php-content-repository-specification/" target="_blank">PHPCR – PHP Content Repository Specification</a>&#8221; Friday 18th May at 5:30 pm on track 2.</p>
<p>The Interview:</p>
<p><strong>Things that you consider before choosing a framework for a project?</strong><br />
As I work in a web agency, the main criteria is does it cover the common use cases. Does it do this in a way that facilitates code reuse and testing?<br />
Furthermore how strong is the community in producing quality extensions and supporting each other?</p>
<p><em><strong>What should i learn next?</strong></em><br />
PHPCR :)</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your throughts about functional programming?</strong></em><br />
Its been a while since I have taken a serious look at functional programming. Back in University we learned Opal. I loved the beauty of the final solutions, but dreaded refactoring.</p>
<p><em><strong>Who&#8217;s your programming hero?</strong></em><br />
My father. I still remember when we got this weird Apricot computer and he wrote an english word trainer in Basic. I &#8220;played&#8221; with it all day :)</p>
<p><strong><em>What features would you like to see in the next PHP version?</em></strong><br />
Getting interfaces for common stuff like caching, logging, http request/response etc.</p>
<p><strong><em>What&#8217;s the average beer per hour factor during conferences and a normal hangout?</em></strong><br />
0.0</p>
<p><strong><em>What do you think about php 5.4 traits?</em></strong><br />
I would have preferred Grafts (<a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/horizontalreuse#grafts_-_class_composition_not_implemented">https://wiki.php.net/rfc/horizontalreuse#grafts_-_class_composition_not_implemented</a>)<br />
We still have a lot of learning to do, but it has the potential of becoming a very significant tool for PHP developers.</p>
<p><strong><em>What do you like and what not about php?</em></strong><br />
I like that so far I never felt that a problem I needed to solve required me to program in another language.</p>
<p><em><strong>Which opensource projects are you following the most?</strong></em><br />
Symfony2 and PHPCR .. though I guess these days also Drupal, despite having never used it, let alone installed it :)</p>
<p><em><strong>Suggest a book to read.</strong></em><br />
I know SQL is not hip these days, but &#8220;SQL Performance Tuning&#8221; by Peter Gulutzan and Trudy Pelzer was probably the most important book for my career. I learned so much, which gave me the confidence to really step up and from there I was able to grow my knowledge in every direction I needed to go.</p>
