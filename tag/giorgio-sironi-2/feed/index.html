				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the ninth &#8216;social&#8217; interview in a series with the phpDay 2012 speakers:<br />
it’s ‘social’ because the questions have been submitted and voted online on Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="https://2012.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/giorgio-sironi.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-272" title="Giorgio Sironi" src="https://2012.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/giorgio-sironi.jpg" alt="Giorgio Sironi" width="97" height="97" /></a> We are happy to introduce you<a title="stefano mainardi bio" href="https://2012.phpday.it/speakers/stefano-mainardi/"> </a><a href="https://2012.phpday.it/speakers/giorgio-sironi/">Giorgio Sironi</a>, a freelance PHP developer and PHPUnit_Selenium mantainer.</p>
<p>He will give a session at phpDay called &#8220;<a href="https://2012.phpday.it/talk/what-they-didnt-tell-you-about-object-oriented-programming-in-php/">What they didn&#8217;t tell you about object programming in PHP</a>&#8221;  Friday 18th May at 11:00 am on track 1.</p>
<p>The Interview:</p>
<p><em><strong>Things that you consider before choosing a framework for a project?</strong></em><br />
Community, documentation, training of my colleagues, and whether I should not use a framework for this project.</p>
<p><em><strong>What should I learn next?</strong></em><br />
Some economics and theory of constraints.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your thoughts about functional programmin</strong></em>g?<br />
Keep an eye on it &#8211; functional languages like Erlang do not only &#8220;solve&#8221; the problem of concurrency but also that of distribution.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sheldon or Leonard?</strong></em><br />
I think that the characters have undergone a progressive Flanderization towards the absurd, due to many filler episodes and an emphasis on product placement instead of geek culture and plot (Sheldon-style response).</p>
<p><em><strong>Who&#8217;s your programming hero?</strong></em><br />
The one that doesn&#8217;t work overtime. Or Alan Kay.</p>
<p><em><strong>What features would you like to see in the next PHP version?</strong></em><br />
Scala case classes, native PSR-0 autoloading and scalar type hints.</p>
<p><em><strong>Who killed JFK?</strong></em><br />
I feel there is already too much an American domination in our culture to allocate time to this question.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about php 5.4 traits?</strong></em><br />
Like inheritance, sometimes useful and easily abused.</p>
<p><em><strong>Duran Duran or Spandau Ballet?</strong></em><br />
I was born in &#8217;88. Who are these people? :)</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you like and what not about php?</strong></em><br />
I like the ease of deployment, hosting support and dynamic typing. I do not like the kitchen-sink let&#8217;s-add-goto and makeCoffee() development model and the focus on procedural programming of the native extensions.</p>
<p><em><strong>Which opensource projects are you following the most?</strong></em><br />
PHPUnit and related projects due to my focus on testing as executable specification.</p>
<p><em><strong>Did your love for programming cause you some troubles with your partner?</strong></em><br />
It did, but I think I have a balance now.</p>
<p><em><strong>Suggest a book to read.</strong></em><br />
Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand.</p>
