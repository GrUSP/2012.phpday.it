				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the fourth ‘social’ interview in a series with the phpDay 2012 speakers: it’s ‘social’ because the questions have been submitted and voted online on Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="https://2012.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Lukas-Kahwe-Smith.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-281" title="Lukas Kahwe Smith" src="https://2012.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Lukas-Kahwe-Smith-150x150.jpg" alt="Lukas Kahwe Smith" width="90" height="90" /></a> We are happy to introduce you <a title="Lukas smith bio" href="https://2012.phpday.it/speakers/lukas-kahwe-smith/" target="_blank">Lukas Smith</a>, an experienced PHP developer, he spends most of his time playing with Symfony2 as well as pushing the PHPCR ecosystem.</p>
<p>He will give a session at phpDay called &#8220;<a title="phpcr lukas talk" href="https://2012.phpday.it/talk/phpcr-php-content-repository-specification/" target="_blank">PHPCR – PHP Content Repository Specification</a>&#8221; Friday 18th May at 5:30 pm on track 2.</p>
<p>The Interview:</p>
<p><strong>Things that you consider before choosing a framework for a project?</strong><br />
As I work in a web agency, the main criteria is does it cover the common use cases. Does it do this in a way that facilitates code reuse and testing?<br />
Furthermore how strong is the community in producing quality extensions and supporting each other?</p>
<p><em><strong>What should i learn next?</strong></em><br />
PHPCR :)</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your throughts about functional programming?</strong></em><br />
Its been a while since I have taken a serious look at functional programming. Back in University we learned Opal. I loved the beauty of the final solutions, but dreaded refactoring.</p>
<p><em><strong>Who&#8217;s your programming hero?</strong></em><br />
My father. I still remember when we got this weird Apricot computer and he wrote an english word trainer in Basic. I &#8220;played&#8221; with it all day :)</p>
<p><strong><em>What features would you like to see in the next PHP version?</em></strong><br />
Getting interfaces for common stuff like caching, logging, http request/response etc.</p>
<p><strong><em>What&#8217;s the average beer per hour factor during conferences and a normal hangout?</em></strong><br />
0.0</p>
<p><strong><em>What do you think about php 5.4 traits?</em></strong><br />
I would have preferred Grafts (<a href="https://wiki.php.net/rfc/horizontalreuse#grafts_-_class_composition_not_implemented">https://wiki.php.net/rfc/horizontalreuse#grafts_-_class_composition_not_implemented</a>)<br />
We still have a lot of learning to do, but it has the potential of becoming a very significant tool for PHP developers.</p>
<p><strong><em>What do you like and what not about php?</em></strong><br />
I like that so far I never felt that a problem I needed to solve required me to program in another language.</p>
<p><em><strong>Which opensource projects are you following the most?</strong></em><br />
Symfony2 and PHPCR .. though I guess these days also Drupal, despite having never used it, let alone installed it :)</p>
<p><em><strong>Suggest a book to read.</strong></em><br />
I know SQL is not hip these days, but &#8220;SQL Performance Tuning&#8221; by Peter Gulutzan and Trudy Pelzer was probably the most important book for my career. I learned so much, which gave me the confidence to really step up and from there I was able to grow my knowledge in every direction I needed to go.</p>

<p>We are happy to introduce you <a title="jacopo romei bio" href="https://2012.phpday.it/speakers/jacopo-romei/" target="_blank">Jacopo Romei</a>, an experienced PHP developer and agile coach.</p>
<p>He will give a session at phpDay called “<a href="https://2012.phpday.it/talk/symfony-cmf/">Symfony CMF</a>” Fri 18th May at 5 pm on track 2 and the workshop &#8220;<a title="test driven development with symfony2" href="https://2012.phpday.it/talk/test-driven-development-with-symfony-2/" target="_blank">Test Driven Development with Symfony2</a>&#8221; Fri 18th May at 11 am on track 3.</p>
<p>Here’s her interview:</p>
<p><em><strong>Things that you consider before choosing a framework for a project?</strong></em><br />
Is it mainstream? Is it supported by a *huge* community? If it&#8217;s<br />
exotic, does it feature something worth its exoticness? Is it *truly*<br />
decoupled and not just packed down in procedures?<br />
The hardest one: do I really need a framework? Often the answer is<br />
&#8220;yes&#8221;, but &#8220;often&#8221; is never &#8220;always&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong><em>What should i learn next?</em></strong><br />
To communicate. Never seen a project fail for a strictly technical<br />
reason. Effective communication is a keypoint. Even good code is a way<br />
to communicate and &#8211; you know? &#8211; it&#8217;s a way to communicate on the<br />
human side of the project. PC would love assembly, so let&#8217;s remind we<br />
write code for humans. :-)</p>
<p><strong><em>What are your thoughts about functional programming?</em></strong><br />
I love it. &#8220;Maybe I&#8217;m amazed&#8221; of the way we keep teaching procedural<br />
style first, then OOP and maybe, at last, functional paradigm. I was<br />
lucky enough to be taught functional programming very early, among<br />
fellow students complaining for those lectures. My default choice for<br />
everyday development is OOP by the way.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sheldon or Leonard?</strong></em><br />
Leonard. Sheldon is funny, but I&#8217;d kill him if it was true and closer<br />
than 50m from me. :-)</p>
<p><em><strong>Who&#8217;s your programming hero?</strong></em><br />
The open source community. If all the efforts and money now put<br />
somewhere else in IT were put in the open source community, we would<br />
live in a way better world. People cares too much about performance or<br />
about design while if only we understood IT is the core of our next<br />
future life, we wouldn&#8217;t give up the open source development model.<br />
All in all Firefox made us free of Internet Explorer, not Chrome. ;-)<br />
Who made the biggest step for a better life?</p>
<p><em><strong>What features would you like to see in the next PHP version?</strong></em><br />
Pure dreamland OK? I&#8217;d love some easy way to compile my PHP libraries<br />
into a PHP extension. I know something similar exists, but here I mean<br />
*easy* as in &#8220;beer&#8221; ;-)</p>
<p><em><strong>Who killed JFK?</strong></em><br />
Gabriella Golia.</p>
<p><em><strong>What&#8217;s the average beer per hour factor during conferences and a normal hangout?</strong></em><br />
4 vs. 1.5.<br />
Though phpDay could feature a lower rate because of Spritz.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about php 5.4 traits?</strong></em><br />
Sharing behaviors horizontally among classes is something I love and<br />
always strive for. I love traits concept and I&#8217;ve been waiting for<br />
them so long. Now it&#8217;s time to get the fun out of them.</p>
<p><em><strong>Duran Duran or Spandau Ballet?</strong></em><br />
This is the hardest one to answer. Duran Duran&#8230;</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you like and what not about php?</strong></em><br />
I *hate* its syntax and all the boilerplate. E.g. I love python&#8217;s<br />
enforced indentation.<br />
I like PHP community and its broad mixed paradigm, going from lambda<br />
functions to *mature* OOP.</p>
<p><em><strong>Which opensource projects are you following the most?</strong></em><br />
Symfony CMF, definitely.<br />
Arduino is also taking some mind-share of mine.</p>
<p><em><strong>Did your love for programming cause you some troubles with your partner?</strong></em><br />
Never. I don&#8217;t overprogram, I hate overtime. I want my life to be<br />
healthy and doing too much of one thing is unhealthy.<br />
Conferences on the other hand are a nice excuse to share some time<br />
travelling together.</p>
<p><em><strong>Suggest a book to read.</strong></em><br />
&#8220;The Black Swan&#8221; by Nassim Taleb.<br />
&#8220;Pro PHP Refactoring&#8221; by Francesco Trucchia and<br />
