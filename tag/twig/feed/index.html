				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the sixth &#8216;social&#8217; interview in a series with the phpDay 2012 speakers:<br />
it’s ‘social’ because the questions have been submitted and voted online on Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="https://2012.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/jordi-boggiano.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-275" title="Jordi Boggiano" src="https://2012.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/jordi-boggiano-150x150.jpg" alt="Jordi Boggiano" width="90" height="90" /></a> We are happy to introduce you <a href="https://2012.phpday.it/speakers/jordi-boggiano/">Jordi Boggiano</a>,  the author of a few open source apps/libs (Composer, Monolog, php-console etc.), and frequent contributor to other OSS projects (Symfony2, Twig and others).</p>
<p>He will give a session at phpDay called &#8220;<a title="Dependency Management with Composer" href="https://2012.phpday.it/talk/dependency-management-with-composer/">Dependency Management with Composer</a>&#8221;  Saturday 19th May at 15:30 pm on track 1.</p>
<p>The Interview:</p>
<p><strong>Things that you consider before choosing a framework for a project?</strong><em><br />
</em> Usually the expected project duration is the main factor. If it&#8217;s going to have to be maintained for the next 5 years, unless it&#8217;s really really simple, I generally start with Symfony. Otherwise Silex for simple/short-term projects. Obviously that&#8217;s based on my personal knowledge, and it does not apply to everyone.</p>
<p><strong>What are your thoughts about functional programming?</strong><br />
Answering this question would not be without side effects.</p>
<p><strong>What features would you like to see in the next PHP version?</strong><br />
Native Unicode support.</p>
<p><strong>Who killed JFK?</strong><br />
Who voted for questions like this? In both cases, I guess sometimes it&#8217;s best if we don&#8217;t know the answer :)</p>
<p><em><strong>What&#8217;s the average beer per hour factor during conferences and a normal hangout?</strong></em><br />
Given $now and $start being unix timestamp, this should draw an accurate function of beer bottles per hour:</p>
<p>$attendees * 9 / M_PI * 2000 * (1.5 / min(3600*3, $now &#8211; $start))</p>
<p>You can try to make a chart out of it as an exercise ;)</p>
<p><strong>Which opensource projects are you following the most?</strong><br />
Composer because I spend most of my free time working on it lately. The<br />
rest is mostly piling up unread notifications on github.</p>
<p><strong>Suggest a book to read.</strong><br />
If you like spaceships and sci-fi, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_Cantos">the Hyperion Cantos</a> is great.</p>
<p>You can find Jordi on twitter (<a title="seldaek twitter" href="https://twitter.com/seldaek">@seldaek</a>) or on<a title="nelm.io jordi" href="https://nelm.io/jordi"> nelm.io page</a>.</p>
