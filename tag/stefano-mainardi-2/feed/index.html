				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the eighth &#8216;social&#8217; interview in a series with the phpDay 2012 speakers:<br />
it’s ‘social’ because the questions have been submitted and voted online on Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="https://2012.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/stefano-mainardi.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-291" title="Stefano Mainardi" src="https://2012.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/stefano-mainardi.jpg" alt="" width="77" height="77" /></a> We are happy to introduce you<a title="stefano mainardi bio" href="https://2012.phpday.it/speakers/stefano-mainardi/"> Stefano Mainardi</a>, a senior PHP developer and <a href="https://www.twinbit.it/">Twinbit</a> project manager and <a href="https://ildn.net/">ILDN &#8211; Italian Linux Distribution Network </a> - founder.</p>
<p>He will give a session at phpDay called &#8220;<a href="https://2012.phpday.it/talk/mobile-drupal/">Mobile Drupal</a>&#8220; Friday 18th May at 12:00 am on track 1.</p>
<p>The Interview:</p>
<p><em><strong>Things that you consider before choosing a framework for a project?</strong></em><br />
The first thing I check is if the name begins with &#8220;Dru&#8221; and ends with &#8220;Pal&#8221;. After this bad joke, the three things I consider essential for a good framework are: community, documentation and feedback from other developers.</p>
<p><em><strong>What should i learn next?</strong></em><br />
Have you heard of Symfony and Drupal 8? :-)<br />
From the human side, speaking in public is something that every good developer should be able to do, if you have ever done, perhaps it&#8217;s time to give it a try.<br />
Finally find more effective techniques for managing your time.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your thoughts about functional programming?</strong></em><br />
Before answering this question I should ask for a consultation at my law firm</p>
<p><em><strong>Sheldon or Leonard?</strong></em><br />
I’m not a big fan, or rather I never had the time to be. I saw a couple of episodes, but I would say that Sheldon is the perfect revenge of any nerds of this planet</p>
<p><em><strong>Who&#8217;s your programming hero?</strong></em><br />
Usually my brother. Ok, seriously, I have no heroes, in the strictest sense of the word. All people who contribute every day to create models of freedom for pure spirit of sharing are my undisputed hero.</p>
<p><em><strong>What features would you like to see in the next PHP version?</strong></em><br />
A native compiler like HipHop from Facebook</p>
<p><strong>Who killed JFK?</strong><br />
Leland Palmer</p>
<p><em><strong>What&#8217;s the average beer per hour factor during conferences and a normal hangout?</strong></em><br />
Whenever I have the perfect algorithm to share with the world, I drink more beer than ever that makes me forget everything.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about php 5.4 traits?</strong></em><br />
A great leap forward.</p>
<p><em><strong>Duran Duran or Spandau Ballet?</strong></em><br />
This is the perfect scenario of the failing question selection algorithm.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you like and what not about php?</strong></em><br />
I love the community, but do not like the lack of self criticism.</p>
<p><em><strong>Which opensource projects are you following the most?</strong></em><br />
Come on, should I really say that again? :P</p>
<p><em><strong>Did your love for programming cause you some troubles with your partner?</strong></em><br />
No, she always believed I was some kind of genius, and it&#8217;s nice to make her believe that. I am also leaving an aura of mystery into believing that I have superpowers that I never revealed</p>
<p><em><strong>Suggest a book to read.</strong></em><br />
I suggest you to contact Jacopo Romei (<a href="https://twitter.com/jacoporomei">@jacoporomei</a>) and ask him what&#8217;s the next book to read: he has a foolproof algorithm.</p>
<p>You can find Stefano on twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/stefanomainardi">@stefanomainardi</a>) and on his <a href="https://www.stefanomainardi.com/">blog</a>.</p>
