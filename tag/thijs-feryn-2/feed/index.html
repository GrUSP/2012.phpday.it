<p>This is the fifth &#8216;social&#8217; interview in a series with the phpDay 2012 speakers:<br />
it’s ‘social’ because the questions have been submitted and voted online on Facebook.</p>
<p><a href="https://2012.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/thijs_feryn.png"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-288" title="Thijs Feryn" src="https://2012.phpday.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/thijs_feryn-150x150.png" alt="Thijs Feryn" width="90" height="90" /></a> We are happy to introduce you <a href="https://2012.phpday.it/speakers/thijs-feryn/">Thijs Feryn</a>, an evangelist at Combell, the number one Belgian hoster, he supports communities and has a particular love for the PHP   community.</p>
<p>He will give a session at phpDay called &#8220;<a title="CLI, the other SAPI" href="https://2012.phpday.it/talk/cli-the-other-sapi/">CLI, the other SAPI</a>&#8221;  Saturday 19th May at 14:30 pm on track 3.</p>
<p>The Interview:</p>
<p><em><strong>Things that you consider before choosing a framework for a project?</strong></em><br />
The learning curve is important, but also if you&#8217;re looking for components or a more full-stack implementation.</p>
<p><em><strong>What should i learn next?</strong></em><br />
Learn C and contribute to PHP. I should start doing that myself, but haven&#8217;t yet. Try to learn about Devops, it&#8217;s interesting material.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are your thoughts about functional programming?</strong></em><br />
Methods are functions too&#8230; so learn the functional stuff and apply it to OO if possible.</p>
<p><strong><em>Sheldon or Leonard?</em></strong><br />
Who? </p>
<p><em><strong>Who&#8217;s your programming hero?</strong></em><br />
I&#8217;m not that geeky to have one.</p>
<p><em><strong>What features would you like to see in the next PHP version?</strong></em><br />
The possibility to pre-compile PHP apps/files either in a compiled phar format or just as compiled php files. </p>
<p><em><strong>Who killed JFK?</strong></em><br />
Your mom (sorry for that). Euhhmmm &#8230; the US government &#8230; I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p><em><strong>What&#8217;s the average beer per hour factor during conferences and a normal hangout?</strong></em><br />
I don&#8217;t even drink alcohol.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you think about php 5.4 traits?</strong></em><br />
I kinda like it.</p>
<p><em><strong>Duran Duran or Spandau Ballet?</strong></em><br />
Slayer!!!</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you like and what not about php?</strong></em><br />
I love the PHP community, but PHP as a language could be more ambitious.</p>
<p><em><strong>Which opensource projects are you following the most?</strong></em><br />
Varnish, Nginx, Zend Framework, PHP itself.</p>
<p><em><strong>Did your love for programming cause you some troubles with your partner?</strong></em><br />
No but the fact that I go to conferences all the time did.</p>
<p><em><strong>Suggest a book to read.</strong></em><br />
Evolution of a cro-magnon by John Joseph.</p>
